VIRTUAL PERSONAL ASSISTANT:  SAS (SECOUR ANALYZING SYSTEM)

Abstract:

Virtual personal assistant is a software that helps in reducing the usage of various input devices such as mouse and keyboard. In this we provide voice commands which makes it user friendly. The program uses NLP (natural language processing), various learning techniques and our social abilities to provide unique experience for users. It is been designed such as that it follows user’s voice commands to provide him/her with the services. Various services that this provide are such as search from web, mathematical calculation, sports and statistical analytics. Our aim is to provide users with a simple yet efficient system which can help them in day-to-day life. It captures you command through microphone, process it and respond using in-built module. For Example, if we ask the system ‘what’s the day?’ using its built-in module, it looks up the day and then returns the response to the user.


As the world is moving towards computing utopia, people are being more consensus towards the virtual world. They are using more and more virtual tools for designing, i.e., from small circuits to large networks are made virtually for testing before implementation, simulations are down virtually. So, virtual reality has become a part of our life. Human to human communication is progressively being replaced by human to computer interaction.An easy access to machine with voice commands is the revolutionary way of human system interaction. To achieve this, we need to use speech to text library for understanding the input. It’s named as Personal Assistant with Voice Recognition Intelligence, which takes the user input in form of voice or text and process it and returns the output in various forms like action to be performed or the search result is dictated to the end user.This software is socially interactive and simulates a kind of human to human .Dialogue. Such assistants are applied in the fields of education and e-learning ,e-commerce, administration, and consulting.The system can perform almost all the tasks that require the use of keyboard and/or mouse which is the main goal of this system that will facilitate the disabled people as they can have our assistant performed any activities using voice inputs.
